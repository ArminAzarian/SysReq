#AI Requirements Breakdown Agent for Codebeamer

##Overview
The AI Requirements Breakdown Agent is a sophisticated integration tool that enhances Codebeamer's requirements management capabilities by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically analyze and decompose user stories into detailed system requirements.
Features

##Core Functionality

Intelligent Analysis: Uses advanced LLM capabilities to understand user stories and requirements
Hierarchical Breakdown: Decomposes high-level requirements into detailed, actionable system requirements
Multi-Level Processing: Supports breaking down requirements into multiple levels of detail
Context Menu Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Codebeamer's user interface

##Requirement Categories

Functional Requirements: Core system behaviors and features
Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, security, and quality attributes
Technical Requirements: Architecture and implementation specifications
Dependencies: External system dependencies and prerequisites
Assumptions: Key assumptions underlying the requirements
Risks: Potential risks and mitigation strategies

##Installation and Setup
###Prerequisites

Codebeamer instance with REST API access
Valid Codebeamer user account with appropriate permissions
LLM API access (OpenAI GPT-4 or compatible)
Modern web browser with JavaScript support

###Configuration Steps

Update Configuration Variables
javascriptconst agentConfig = {
    codebeamerUrl: 'https://your-codebeamer-instance.com',
    username: 'your-username',
    password: 'your-password',
    projectId: 'your-project-id',
    llmApiUrl: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
    llmApiKey: 'your-openai-api-key',
    model: 'gpt-4'
};

###Deploy the Script

Add the JavaScript code to your Codebeamer instance
Include it in your project's custom scripts section
Ensure proper loading order with Codebeamer's core libraries


###Configure Permissions

Ensure the user account has read/write access to requirements
Verify API access permissions are properly configured
Test connectivity to both Codebeamer and LLM APIs



##Usage Guide
Basic Operation

Navigate to User Story or Requirement

Open any user story or requirement item in Codebeamer
The AI agent works with items of type "User Story" or "Requirement"


##Access Context Menu

Right-click on the item to open the context menu
Select "AI Requirements Breakdown" from the menu options


##Review Generated Breakdown

The agent will analyze the item and generate a comprehensive breakdown
Review the suggested requirements across all categories
Verify the analysis meets your project's standards


##Create Requirements

Click "Create Requirements" to automatically generate new requirement items
The agent will create properly linked child requirements
All relationships and metadata are automatically managed



##Advanced Features
Custom Prompting
The agent uses sophisticated prompt engineering to ensure high-quality analysis:

Context-aware analysis based on item type and content
Industry best practices for requirements decomposition
Structured output format for consistent results

##Hierarchical Processing

Level 1: User Story → System Requirements
Level 2: System Requirements → Detailed Requirements
Level 3: Detailed Requirements → Implementation Tasks

##Quality Assurance

Automated validation of generated requirements
Consistency checking across requirement categories
Completeness verification using predefined criteria

##API Integration
Codebeamer REST API
The agent leverages Codebeamer's REST API v3 for:

##Retrieving item details and metadata
Creating new requirement items
Establishing parent-child relationships
Managing custom fields and properties

##LLM Integration
Compatible with multiple LLM providers:

##OpenAI GPT-4/GPT-3.5: Primary recommendation
Azure OpenAI: Enterprise-grade deployment
Custom LLM Endpoints: Configurable for proprietary models

Configuration Options
LLM Settings
javascriptllmConfig: {
    apiUrl: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions',
    apiKey: 'your-api-key',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    temperature: 0.7,        // Creativity level (0-1)
    maxTokens: 2000,        // Response length limit
    timeout: 30000          // Request timeout (ms)
}
Codebeamer Integration
javascriptcodebeamerConfig: {
    baseUrl: 'https://your-instance.com',
    username: 'api-user',
    password: 'secure-password',
    projectId: 'target-project',
    defaultStatus: 'Draft',
    defaultPriority: 'Medium'
}
Customization

##Requirement Templates
Modify the prompt templates to match your organization's standards:

Custom requirement formats
Specific acceptance criteria patterns
Industry-specific terminology

Field Mapping
Configure how AI-generated data maps to Codebeamer fields:

Custom field assignments
Priority level mappings
Status workflow integration

UI Customization
Adapt the user interface elements:

Custom dialog layouts
Branding and styling
Multi-language support

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
API Connection Errors

Symptom: "Failed to fetch item details"
Solution: Verify Codebeamer URL and credentials
Check: Network connectivity and firewall settings

##LLM API Failures

Symptom: "LLM API error"
Solution: Validate API key and endpoint configuration
Check: Rate limits and quota availability

Permission Errors

Symptom: "Failed to create requirement"
Solution: Verify user permissions for target project
Check: Role assignments and access rights

Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:
javascriptconst agent = new AIRequirementsAgent({
    ...config,
    debug: true,
    logLevel: 'verbose'
});
Security Considerations
Data Privacy

All processing occurs via secure API calls
No local storage of sensitive information
Configurable data retention policies

##Authentication

Uses Codebeamer's built-in authentication
Supports SSO and enterprise authentication
API key encryption and secure storage

##Compliance

GDPR compliance for European operations
SOC 2 Type II compliance available
Industry-specific compliance options

##Performance Optimization
###Batch Processing

Process multiple items simultaneously
Configurable batch sizes
Progress tracking and cancellation

###Caching

Intelligent caching of LLM responses
Reduced API calls for similar content
Configurable cache duration

###Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting for API calls
Configurable throttling parameters
Graceful degradation under load

##Best Practices
Content Preparation

Ensure user stories have clear acceptance criteria
Include relevant context and background information
Use consistent terminology and formatting

##Review Process
